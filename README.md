# Hi, I'm Anvi 👋  
### Young AI Founder • Creator of Aethos • Building the future of Meta‑AI

I'm an 8th‑grade student starting a multi‑year journey to build **Aethos** —  
an AI system that can design, train, and optimize other AI models.

### What I'm working on right now:
- Learning Python and machine learning fundamentals  
- Building my first “mini‑Aethos” prototype  
- Studying neural network architectures  
- Documenting everything in my Aethos Year Zero repo  

### My mission:
To create the next generation of AI — AI that builds AI.

Follow along as I grow Aethos from an idea into a real platform.
